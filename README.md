Use Case: Blog Application
----------------------------
1. Angular Components:
Create a PostListComponent component to display a list of blog posts.
Develop a PostDetailComponent to show the detailed view of a blog post.
Implement a CommentComponent for displaying comments on a post.
2. Angular Directive:
Use a custom directive, let's call it appHighlight, to highlight certain elements, such as important words or tags, within blog posts.
3. Angular Forms:
Utilize an AddPostComponent with an Angular form to allow users to create and submit new blog posts.
Implement a form in the CommentComponent for users to add comments to a blog post.
4. Angular Routes, Guards, and Services:
- Set up routes for navigating between the list of posts (PostListComponent), individual post details (PostDetailComponent), and adding a new post (AddPostComponent).
- Implement a route guard, AuthGuard, to protect the AddPostComponent route, ensuring only authenticated users can add new posts.
- Create an AuthService to manage user authentication, and use it in conjunction with the route guard to control access.
By combining these Angular features, you've created a robust blog application where users can view a list of posts, read detailed post views, add comments, and submit new blog posts. The use of components, directives, forms, routes, guards, and services contributes to a well-organized and modular Angular application.
